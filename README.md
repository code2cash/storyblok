## Looking for the Storyblok CLI?

The Storyblok CLI is now in it's own separate repository. You can find it here: <https://github.com/storyblok/storyblok-cli>

## Reporting bugs
We're sorry if you've encountered a bug while using Storyblok. Your help in identifying and reporting the issue is greatly appreciated! We used to use Github issues to track bugs, but we've recently switched to using the Storyblok service desk, as it tends to make our work easier together with our support team. You can find it here <https://storyblok.atlassian.net/servicedesk>.
